# This code takes a JSON file (dag chain data structure) and verifies if there are any gaps in it. 

Note: If the dag-chain structure changes, then code has to be modified to work with new structure.

Build instructions: 
1. Have go environment setup. I have tested it in go 1.17. But it should work in older env as well. 
2. Just do go build -o verifyDagChain to compile.


Run instructions: 
1. Save the dag-json as a file and pass it as argument to this binary. 
	e.g: verifyDagChain <path>/trade_volume_dag_chain.json

#TODO: This can be enhanced to look for CIDâ€™s in ipfs for a project by retrieving last_dag_cid  from redis and then using ipfs to fetch it, find out prevCID and so on go backtracking through the dag chain to find gaps.
